      <Title level={3}>Sprint 1 - Authentication Flow</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        Prior to my joining the GoodStuff team, Reef Loretto had already
        implemented a lot of the bare features of the app without integrating
        the company's brand. He had used AWS Amplify for the backend and for
        authentication he was using the default components provided by AWS.
        Trisha Guttal (the designer for the team) and I collaborated to create a
        new authentication flow with both of us conducting market research, her
        focusing on design, and me brining her designs to life.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Here is the before:</Paragraph>
      <div className="center">
        <img
          src={awsAuth}
          alt="how the authentication looked before the redesign"
          style={{ width: "50%" }}
        />
      </div>
      <Paragraph>And here is the after:</Paragraph>
      <div className="centered-row" id="auth">

        />
      </div>
      <Title level={3}>Sprint 2 - Designing the User Profile</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        After rebranding the authentication flow, I wasn't able to develop
        anymore because major design choices had to be made. Therefore, I
        strongly advocated for design meetings were we discussed user flow, what
        should be included in the MVP, and scope.

        Next, I took up fully redesigning and implementing a redesign for the
        "Post a Request/Listing" feature of the app.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>I started off with some market research:</Paragraph>

      </div>
      <div className="center">
        <img src={applications} alt="applications" />
      </div>
      <Paragraph>Then, I elevated the pre-existing UI:</Paragraph>

        <img
          src={redesign}
          alt="redesign"

      <Title level={3}>Sprint 4 - App-Wide Rebrand</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        Finally, by the last sprint, while I was working on rebranding select
        features of the app, we finally had a general redesign for the entire
        app. Although I wasn't able to implement all the redesigns I worked on
        elevating as many features as possible.
