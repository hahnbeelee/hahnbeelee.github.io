            It's best to have the designs made before frontend development.

      <Title level={3}>Sprint 1 - Authentication Flow</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        Prior to my joining the GoodStuff team, Reef Loretto had already
        implemented a lot of the bare features of the app without styling. He
        had used AWS Amplify for the backend and for authentication he was using
        the default components provided by AWS. Trisha Guttal (the designer for
        the team) and I collaborated to create a new authentication flow with
        both of us conducting market research, her focusing on design, and me
        brining her designs to life.

      <Paragraph>
        Jeremy, one of the co-founders, created a Miro board to help the team
        see the big picture. I color-coded and added a key to better our
        understanding of the scope of the project.
