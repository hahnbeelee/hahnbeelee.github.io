      <Paragraph>
        For onboarding, my first task was to learn React/Redux by taking the{" "}
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/">
          {" "}
          Modern React with Redux Udemy course (Stephen Grider)
        </a>{" "}
        . Through this course, I started my journey with React/Redux and learned
        how to make basic components, set up redux, a foundational file
        structure, best practices, and code reusability. Click{" "}
        <a href="/react-components">here</a> to see some of the small web apps I
        made during this onboarding/learning experience.

      <Title level={3}>Implementing User Profile</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        During my time at Leidos, the GEOAxIS team was in the process of
        redesigning and upgrading their Identity Management (Idam) service
        provided to the National Geospatial Agency (NGA). The website's UI was
        very outdated and implemented without javascript and was in need of an
        update.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Thus, I was assigned to implement the user profile section of the
        redesign. I started off with receiving the wireframes from the UX team
        and analyzing the code base and determining which components already
        existed.
      </Paragraph>
      {/* insert google slides */}
      <Paragraph>
        Unfortunately, the website INSERT WEBSITE LINK is proprietary and is not
        accessible unless you have the correct credentials, but I was able to
        snag this single screenshot of my creation:
      </Paragraph>
      {/* insert image√∑ */}
      <Paragraph>
        The show more/less buttons are interactive, and all the information
        displayed was hooked up using redux. It was predicted that this would
        take me an entire sprint to complete, but I ended up completing it in 2
        days!
      </Paragraph>
      <Title level={3}>Implementing Storybook</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        Then, I was assigned to add Storybook to the codebase. Storybook is
        INSERT DESCRIPTION. For our team, we specifically wanted it because our
        components folder was getting quite large and it was getting harder to
        promote reusability and decrease repeat code. Additionally, Storybook
        would allow the UX team to test and judge the front-end developers'
        implementation of their designs.
      </Paragraph>
      <Title level={3}>Automating Deployment with Ansible</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        Lastly, I dabbled in some DevOps by helping out with automating the
        deployment process. Since we were in the process of a rapid redesign
        (with an encroaching deadline), it was important that stakeholders and
        other teams can easily view our progress. Therefore, I automated a once
        manual process by creating Ansible playbooks and adding them to the
        Ansible Tower. CHECK THIS.
